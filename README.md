# Request Blocker

Blocks incoming requests from the same IP address, if there are too many of them.

## Design

### Explanation

Since we have a hypothetical high-load application we need to tune counters' read AND write operations.

Since reads and writes are 1-1 we should focus on writes.

The best known way to optimize write operations is **sharding**.

üí° Therefore, we use organized shards!

There are two storage options to use:

- with simple [HashMaps](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashMap.html) (faster,
  but drains this process' RAM)
- with [Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com) (slower, but RAM is used in a separate process + all Hazelcast configuration
  options)

Default option is simple storage. You can use Hazelcast via `storage-hazelcast` Spring profile.

### Important note!

Both [@Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Configuration.html)
and [@Component](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Component.html)
bean creation mechanisms are present. This is done intentionally for
demonstration purposes.

### Achieved bullet points

‚úîÔ∏è Limitations and shard sizes are configured in [these](src/main/resources/application.yml) properties.

‚úîÔ∏è Can be added quickly, like
in [this](src/main/java/ru/alexander/request_blocker/web_server/service/impl/SomeProtectedServiceImpl.java) class.

‚úîÔ∏è Best practices are applied to make this functionality fast in high-load applications.

‚úîÔ∏è [Unit test that calls endpoint from random IP addresses in parallel](src/test/java/ru/alexander/request_blocker/web_server/controller/BlankSampleControllerTest.java)
is present.

## Usage

Protected endpoints have a limit of 3 requests from one IP address within 30 seconds.

Available endpoints:

- [/sample_ip_protected](https://request-blocker.herokuapp.com/sample_ip_protected) - IP-protected endpoint
- [/sample_ip_unprotected](https://request-blocker.herokuapp.com/sample_ip_unprotected) - protection is disabled
- [/shared_service_a](https://request-blocker.herokuapp.com/shared_service_a)
  and  [/shared_service_b](https://request-blocker.herokuapp.com/shared_service_b) - Both endpoints share underlying
  limit checker. The limitation is the same.

We also have [actuators](https://request-blocker.herokuapp.com/actuator):

- [/health](https://request-blocker.herokuapp.com/actuator/health) - basic info about services' health
- [/metrics](https://request-blocker.herokuapp.com/actuator/metrics) - metrics of the app
- [/prometheus](https://request-blocker.herokuapp.com/actuator/prometheus) - addition to the time series for monitoring
  via Prometheus
